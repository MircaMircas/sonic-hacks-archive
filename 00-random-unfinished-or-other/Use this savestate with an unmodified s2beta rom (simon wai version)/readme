Does anyone happen to have a copy of Nayr's ancient Sonic 2 Alpha hoax patch, the one with working Hidden Palace and stuff?

I can't find a copy of that ANYWHERE... I just want it 'cause I love those wacky hoax roms. :-)

 I was super depressed just now and I just happened to see this topic. That really cheered me up =) I have it. Let me find it real quick.. it's on my other computer.

EDIT: they aren't functional without the savestates to them.. this is something that was my fault, but I still have the layouts intact and I'll whip up a new hack with the layouts that were meant to be in there. You're really not missing much >.>

EDIT 2: CPZ works? Doesn't work in my version o__o Must be before I fucked it up badly XD

EDIT 3: Use this savestate with an unmodified s2beta rom (simon wai version)
