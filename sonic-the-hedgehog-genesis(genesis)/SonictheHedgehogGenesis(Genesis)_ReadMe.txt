Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis (Genesis) is a hack of Sonic the Hedgehog which attempts to recreate certain aspects of the Game Boy Advance Sonic 1 port titled Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis.

==Ported Features==

*Physics which closely match those of the GBA game, noticeable during Eggman confrontations as the player can bounce off the top of him repeatedly.
*Spin Dash which has slow animation and dust that appears slightly before the spin starts.
*Background effects, like moving clouds.
*Fixed Caterkiller-damage bug, scrolling-left-too-fast bug, die-during-level-resize bugs.
*Applied a Left boundary teleport fix, signpost art loading and collision fix, skippable score countdown, "walking jump" fix, momentum preservation, "press start" fix and edits, altered rebound physics, altered jump physics, etc.
*Sonic's sprite art and the life counter text are replaced with the different art from S1GBA.
*The scrolling is changed to give a better sense of speed and Sonic CD-style lookahead (that's not in S1GBA, but neither is a bigger screen).
*All springs double Sonic's max speed until landing if airborne before the spring counter runs out. All side-facing red springs act like yellow springs. To compensate for the lower speed, slope repel calculations aren't performed after hitting a spring. Vertical springs erase all horizontal velocity not in a direction being pressed.
