Made it so you can duck while moving at slight speed, similar to S&K (though unlike S&K this does not change how fast you have to be to roll)

Removed air speed cap

Added S3K-style Super transformation, except you have to use alternating buttons, and you can detransform

Made Tails able to enter Debug Mode
