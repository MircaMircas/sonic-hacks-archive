Overpowered Sonic The Hedgehog 2 (a.k.a Project Overpowered) is a hack made by me. In this hack, the only things that differ from Sonic 2 is the physics, the text, the palette and the boss health is changed from 8 to 10. I am going to state the changes in each status.

Physics-The physics are you guessed it, Overpowered.
-Sonic: Extremely overpowered, speed, spindash, jumping, etc...
Super Sonic: Speed is 1/2x normal Sonic except he has the twice of Sonic's jump height.
-Tails: Slower than Sonic, but both have the same jump height.

Palette
-Sonic: Darker Blue
-Tails: Darker Orange

Text
-Now says ©DASH 2016.

Boss Battles
-Health changes from 8 hits to 10 hits, Final Boss now needs 17 hits until defeat. I changed this since Sonic and Tails would easily defeat them.

Those are all the changes I made in this ROM hack. I hope you enjoy it!

P.S. Speed Sneakers are changed to Jump Sneakers(you will jump higher).
