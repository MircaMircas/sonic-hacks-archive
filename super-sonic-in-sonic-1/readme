Super Sonic in Sonic the Hedgehog is hack by 
Puto which adds the ability to turn into Super 
Sonic when obtaining all the Chaos Emeralds or using a 
button code. Although other people have incorporated Super 
Sonic into their Sonic hacks, this hack's main purpose is to add the 
ability to transform into Super Sonic. Super Sonic's abilities from Sonic 
3 & Knuckles were added in addition to using the Super Sonic sprites 
of Sonic the Hedgehog 2.
