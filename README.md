# sonic-hacks-archive
If you have any hacks you want to add to this repo email me at shr4356@protonmail.com

This is a pretty basic archive of sonic hacks. This is made up of more than a few years worth of downloads and genesis torrents, so don't be surprised if you find multiple copies with different names. 

I started this when I decided to download some new sonic hacks to be part of an xmas gift after a while of not keeping up on them (having my child three years ago). I noticed that there where a lot of dead links out there of hacks with no other source to download them and I also noticed that searching on google for some of the hacks I already have would come up with no info what so ever.

Non of this is my work
