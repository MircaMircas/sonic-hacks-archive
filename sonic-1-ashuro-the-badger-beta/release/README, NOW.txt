ASHURO THE BADGER: Notice

There is only 3 playable zones, from Frozen Island act 1 to the Pyramid Trap's boss.
There is no giant rings, because special stages removed (for now).
If you want the Dark Emeralds (instead of Chaos), you have to SEARCH and FIND the unique EMERALD MONITOR, hidden on each act 2 and 3 of each zone.
1 emerald monitor for Frozen Island act 2, 1 emerald monitor for Frozen Island act 3, 1 emerald monitor for Deep Crystal act 2, and so on...
There is 6 emerald monitors (but for now, it's useless to catch them because the end of the demo was the same, but if you want challenge, find them).

There is not bubbles into the aquatic level Deep Crystal, you have to search and find a BUBBLE MONITOR (he gives infinite air, but if you died, you have to find it again).

The EGGMAN MONITOR makes you hurt, but if you want to jump onto, without having hurt, you have to use the "KICK ATTACK" (A+A or B+A).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay dude, i know that i have to help you because the movesets 
of this hack are quite difficult to understand.

SO!

JUMP: 			A or B

DOUBLE JUMP: 		A+B, or B+B
(the double jump make Ashuro swim underwater)

"KICK ATTACK": 		A+A, or B+A 
(This ability isn't the final version, i have to code it to make Ashuro go
to the floor quickly. (not underwater). 
This ability make you able to destroy enemies underwater when you swim.
You can also jump onto a Eggman Monitor, to use it like a platform to jump more higher.
This is why you can't destroy monitors with it.)
 

SUPER PEELOUT: 	Up + A, or B
(for example, if you want to use the dash boost more quickly.
The super peelout is also more powerful than the spindash (you go to your max speed)).

SPINDASH: 		Down + A, or B
(No matter how you push A or B, you will go to the same speed.
This is a bug that i have to fix in my sonic.asm.
You can just destroy monitors, enemies, walls...)

DASH BOOST:		Left or Right + C (when you are at max speed)
(you need to go at your max speed in the "run" animation,
this ability make you able to destroy only enemies, not the monitors.
(maybe, soon, destroy walls)
Also, you're not invincible, take care of yourself with spikes.)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will fix all the bug later. 
The level layout of Frozen Island will be fixed soon.

There is no level select because i don't want you to see my work into the other zones, into the sound test and the special stages...

This a demo of 3 zones playables, from Frozen Island to Pyramid Trap, so sorry but, do with it :)

Thank you for all the critics and good comments, that help me more.

Sorry for my bad english.

Ashuro.
